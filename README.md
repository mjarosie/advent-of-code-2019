# advent-of-code-2019

Repository contains my solutions to the puzzles of [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019).
I took this year's Advent of Code as an opportunity to learn Haskell language.

Puzzles are split into separate directories, one day each. Every puzzle is divided in 2 parts.
